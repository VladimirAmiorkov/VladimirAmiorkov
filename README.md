# $ echo "Hello, World"

My name is Vladimir. I build iOS apps (Swift, SwiftUI, TCA) with a focus on clean architecture, performance, and smooth user experience. I am very interested in cross-platform system designs, leveraging Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and/or similar approaches to share core logic inside systems.
